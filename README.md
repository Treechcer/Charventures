# Font

I use [Press Start 2p](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) font that you can download here. If authors have any problem of me using this font I'll pull it just contact me. Which they shouldn't because it's under [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://openfontlicense.org) license.

# Charventures

This is my game project where I'll try to make game with graphical restriction of using only ASCII (or UNICODE, we'll see) characters. I'm thinking of making this game kinda like rogue-like, RPG game or adventure game - not sure which one yet.

# Gameplay now

- you can move (you're the yellowish `@`)
- you can go through doors (`(`, `)`, `V` and `^` -- which isn't the best character but T'll leave it for now)
- for now that's all

# future

- enemies 
- better generating of the map (I'll need to get smarter on that topic, I would start today but I didn't had time -- 17.6.)
- goal and score (goal like killing all the enemies and score by killing them and collecting some power ups)
- health, damage, abilities... And more "rogue-like" / "adventure" stuff
- & more

# currently working on

- better map generation 
- effects of ground (eg. `~` = water that slows down etc.)
