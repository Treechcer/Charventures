# Font

I use [Press Start 2p](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) font that you can download here. If authors have any problem of me using this font I'll pull it just contact me. Which they shouldn't because it's under [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](https://openfontlicense.org) license.

This is my game project where I'll try to make game with graphical restriction of using only characters. I'm thinking of making this game kinda like rogue-like, RPG game or adventure game - not sure which one yet.
